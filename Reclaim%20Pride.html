<title>Reclaim Pride</title>
</head><body>	<div class="entry-meta"><a class="entry-date published">2018-04-29T19:00:00.000Z</a></div><p><p>For years, Capital Pride has ignored the concerns of queer, trans, Black, Latinx, and Two-Spirit communities in D.C. regarding its complicity with entities that harm LGBTQ2S people. Since March 2017, No Justice No Pride has been working to ensure that Capital Pride addresses our concerns, but time and time we have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Even in the current political moment - with the Trump Administration pursuing anti-immigrant, anti-trans, anti-LGBQ2S, anti-women, anti-Black, anti-Muslim, anti-poor, and pro-white supremacist policies - Capital Pride insists on continuing business as usual, ignoring the most marginalized members of our community. We MUST fight back and bring pride back to it's roots.</p>
