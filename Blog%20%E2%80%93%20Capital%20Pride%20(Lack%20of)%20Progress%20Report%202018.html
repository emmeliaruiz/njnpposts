<title>Blog – Capital Pride (Lack of) Progress Report 2018</title>
</head><body>	<div class="entry-meta"><a class="entry-date published">2018-04-28T19:00:00.000Z</a></div><p><p>Despite lip service, “community forums,” and a stated desire to work with the community, Capital Pride’s lack of substantive change extends its legacy of neglecting marginalized communities into 2018.
