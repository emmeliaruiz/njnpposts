<title>DC: Capital Pride (Lack of) Progress Report 2018</title>
</head><body>	<div class="entry-meta"><a class="entry-date published">2018-04-28T19:00:00.000Z</a></div><p><p><strong><span>Despite lip service, “community forums,” and a stated desire to work with the community, Capital Pride’s lack of substantive change extends its legacy of neglecting marginalized communities into 2018. All signs indicate that Capital Pride 2018 will once again celebrate weapons manufacturers, corrupt banks, and police departments, aligning itself with those who profit off of the oppression of the most marginalized members of our communities.</span></strong></p></p>
