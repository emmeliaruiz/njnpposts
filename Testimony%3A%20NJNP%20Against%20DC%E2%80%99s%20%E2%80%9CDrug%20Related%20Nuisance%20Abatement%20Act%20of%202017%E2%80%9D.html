<p id="908c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No Justice No Pride (NJNP) is a collective of organizers and activists from across the District of Columbia that exists to fight for the most marginalized members of DC’s trans and queer communities. Through our Trans Justice campaign, we focus on fighting for a city where trans communities live free from violence, with the resources and autonomy necessary to build the futures we choose.</p></p>
