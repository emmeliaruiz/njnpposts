<p id="f394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we are concerned for the well-being of trans individuals currently serving in the military, we are skeptical of the “outrage,” calls for protest, and fundraising appeals we are seeing from LGBT folks and their allies. Many of those coming out the loudest against the ban on trans military service have been silent as trans folks across the country continue to be killed, as they continue to suffer harassment and violence at the hands of police, and as they continue to be denied housing, jobs, healthcare, respect, and dignity.</p>
<p id="7e51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ve been in the streets<span> </span><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@NJNP/another-world-is-possible-fighting-back-against-dcs-marginalization-of-trans-women-2d9c7aab9c17" target="_blank">showing up for trans folks</a>. Where have you been? What have you been doing?</p>
<p id="ce61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are deeply skeptical of the degree to which criticisms of the ban on trans military service ignore the grave injustices carried out by the U.S. military and the military industrial complex. It is possible — and necessary — to criticize policies that single out and attack trans individuals while refusing to endorse, support, or celebrate the U.S. military. Pandering to dangerous sentiments of nationalism and patriotism is no way to garner respect and dignity for trans folks. We will not allow the trans community to be leveraged to support U.S. militarism and imperialism.</p>
<p id="fcac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We reject the the idea that trans military service should be a priority for the movement for trans liberation. As other trans activists and scholars have pointed out, advocacy around military service only became visible after wealthy billionaire donors, “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/25015-transgender-activists-speak-out-against-campaign-to-end-trans-military-ban" target="_blank">dedicated to celebrating the US military” put their money behind it.</a><span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">For trans individuals, the right to housing, jobs, food, healthcare, education, and safety should not be contingent on putting one’s life on the line in service of the U.S. war machine.</span></p>

<p id="1dae" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When thinking about how to respond to Trump’s ban on trans military service, it’s important to listen to the voices of trans folks first. Today, we’ve been inspired by the words of some of our trans comrades on our newsfeeds:</p>
<blockquote id="def9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">There are trans people RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA who are homeless, jobless, without healthcare, being denied access to food and resources and you know this. There are trans people RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA who still have not received JUSTICE for the state sanctioned violence we face every day from this murderous regime. And you want me to give my life to a country that never gave a fuck about me? Now you all of a sudden y’all care about trans people? Because of the military… who are you and why are you here? Go ahead and make a difference!<span> </span><a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.twocc.us/donate" target="_blank">www.twocc.us/donate</a>

<blockquote id="2be7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This ban serves as a disturbing model for trans health care in the US and how institutions will further fail to protect us. To be considered a burden because we demand and deserve affordable and equitible care is nothing short of dehumanizing. BUT most importantly, where are y’all when TWOC are being murdered and abused on the streets? That’s the crux right there. We live on these frontlines daily, and if only cis advocacy could shift it’s focus to what’s really affecting us, we’ll actually feel like we’re heard rather than cis folks steering a ship that’s not theirs. Don’t get me wrong, cis folks do play a crucial and necessary part in all of this, but when an issue like this is what creates your yearning for allyship, then you’re missing the big picture”</blockquote>

<p id="81d0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">We refuse to make the ability of trans (and queer) individuals to serve as oppressive agents of the state a central part of our vision of trans liberation. Our liberation cannot and will not be achieved by gaining access to systems fueled by death and destruction. We reject the arguments of those who reduce this issue to a matter of equality versus inequality, because fighting for equality within a corrupt and oppressive system perpetuates injustice.</p>
<p id="21d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">And to those who claim that military service presents a viable employment opportunity for trans folks — we encourage you to take a moment to examine the systemic barriers to trans employment that make this line of thinking possible.</em></p>
<p id="12b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is our sincere hope that those mobilizing today in opposition to the trans military ban also recognize their duty to mobilize in opposition to rampant discrimination against trans individuals everywhere. We implore cisgender allies to think twice before celebrating the possibility of trans folks putting their lives on a line for a country that has yet to affirm or respect their value as human beings.</p>
